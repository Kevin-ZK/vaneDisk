	<description>This application enables vaneDisk to lock files while reading or writing to and from backend storage. The purpose of the app is to avoid file corruption during normal operation. Operating at a very low level in the vaneDisk app, this application requests and respects file system locks. For example, when vaneDisk is writing an uploaded file to the server, vaneDisk requests a write lock. If the underlying storage supports locking, vaneDisk will request and maintain an exclusive write lock for the duration of this write operation. When completed, vaneDisk will then release the lock through the file system.
If the file system does not support locking, there is no need to enable this application as any lock requested by vaneDisk will not be honored in the underlying file system. More information is available in the File Locking documentation.
