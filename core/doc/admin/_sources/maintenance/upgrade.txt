==============================
Upgrading Your ownCloud Server
==============================

It is best to keep your ownCloud server upgraded regularly, and to install all 
point releases and major releases without skipping any of them, as skipping 
releases increases the risk of errors. Major releases are 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, and 
point releases are intermediate releases for each major release. For example, 
8.0.1 and 8.0.2 are point releases.

.. note:: **Downgrading** is not supported and risks corrupting your data! If 
   you want to revert to an older ownCloud version, install it from scratch 
   and then restore your data from backup. Before doing this, file a support 
   ticket (if you have paid support) or ask for help in the ownCloud forums to 
   see if your issue can be resolved without downgrading.

Version numbering changed with ownCloud 8.0. Major releases are now indicated 
by the second number, so 8.0. 8.1, and 8.2 are major releases. The third number 
indicates an intermediate release, e.g. 8.0.5.

.. note:: If you are using the Encryption app and upgrading from older 
   versions of ownCloud to ownCloud 8.0, you must manually migrate your 
   encryption keys with the *occ* command after the upgrade is complete, like 
   this example for CentOS:
   *sudo -u apache php occ encryption:migrate*
   You must run *occ* as your HTTP user. See 
   :doc:`../configuration_server/occ_command` to learn more about *occ*

There are multiple ways to keep your ownCloud server upgraded: with the Updater 
App (Server Edition only), with your Linux package manager, and by manually 
upgrading. In this chapter you will learn how to keep your ownCloud installation 
current with your Linux package manager, and by manually upgrading.

(See :doc:`update` to learn about the Updater App.)

.. note:: Before upgrading to a new major release, always first review any 
   third-party apps you have installed for compatibility with  
   the new ownCloud release. Any apps that are not developed by ownCloud show a 
   3rd party designation. Install unsupported apps at your own risk. Then, 
   before the upgrade, they must all be disabled. After the upgrade is 
   complete and you are sure they are compatible with the new ownCloud 
   release you may re-enable them.

Preferred Upgrade Method
------------------------

The best method for keeping ownCloud on Linux servers current is by 
configuring your system to use the `openSUSE Build Service 
<http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=isv:ownCloud:community& 
package=owncloud>`_ (see :doc:`../installation/linux_installation`); just 
follow the instructions on oBS for setting up your package manager. Then 
stay current by using your Linux package manager to upgrade. 

.. note:: Enterprise Subscription customers will use their Enterprise software
   repositories to install and update their ownCloud installations, rather 
   than the openSUSE Build Service. Please see    
   :doc:`../enterprise_installation/linux_installation` for more information.

You should always maintain regular backups (see :doc:`../maintenance/backup`), 
and make a backup before every upgrade.

When a new ownCloud release is available you will see a yellow banner in your 
ownCloud Web interface.

**Upgrading is disruptive**. When you upgrade ownCloud with your Linux package 
manager, that is just the first step to applying the upgrade. After 
downloading the new ownCloud packages your session will be interrupted, and you 
must run the upgrade wizard to complete the upgrade, which is discussed in the 
next section.

Upgrading With Your Linux Package Manager
-----------------------------------------

When an ownCloud upgrade is available from the openSUSE Build Service 
repository, you can apply it just like any normal Linux upgrade. For example, 
on Debian or Ubuntu Linux this is the standard system upgrade command::

 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
 
Or you can upgrade just ownCloud with this command::

 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install owncloud
 
On Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux use ``yum`` to see all available updates::

 $ yum check-update
 
You can apply all available updates with this command::
 
 $ sudo yum update
 
Or update only ownCloud::
 
 $ sudo yum update owncloud
 
Your Linux package manager only downloads the current ownCloud packages. There 
is one more step, and that is to run the upgrade wizard to perform the final 
steps of updating the database and turning off maintenance mode. After using 
your package manager to install the current ownCloud release, you will see two 
screens. On the first screen, click the Start Upgrade button, or optionally run 
the ``occ upgrade`` command instead of clicking the button. 

.. figure:: ../images/updater-8.png

``occ upgrade`` 
is more reliable, especially on installations with large datasets and large 
numbers of users because it avoids the risk of PHP timeouts. 

.. note:: The ``occ`` command does not download ownCloud updates. You must first download
   the updated code, and then ``occ`` performs the final upgrade steps.

The ``occ`` command 
is in your ``owncloud/`` directory. You must run it as your HTTP user. This 
example is for Debian/Ubuntu::

 $ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
 
Before completing the upgrade, ownCloud first runs a simulation by copying all 
database tables to a temporary directory and then performing the upgrade on 
them, to ensure that the upgrade will complete correctly. This takes twice as 
much time, which on large installations can be many hours, so you can omit this 
step with the ``--skip-migration-test`` option::

 $ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade --skip-migration-test 
 
This example is for Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux::

 $ sudo -u apache php occ upgrade 
 
Or::

  $ sudo -u apache php occ upgrade -skip-migration-test

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is ``www-data``.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS/RHEL is ``apache``.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is ``http``.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is ``wwwrun``, and the HTTP group is ``www``. 

See :doc:`../configuration_server/occ_command` to learn more about using the 
``occ`` command, and see the **Setting Strong Directory Permissions** section 
of :doc:`../installation/installation_wizard` to learn how to find your 
HTTP user.

When the upgrade is successful you will see the following screen:

.. figure:: ../images/updater-7.png

After upgrading, verify that your ownCloud
directory permissions are set according to the **Setting Strong Directory Permissions** 
section of :doc:`../installation/installation_wizard`.

If the upgrade fails, then you must try a manual upgrade.

Manual Upgrade Procedure
------------------------

If you are upgrading to a major release, for example from 7.0.5 to 
8.0, you must review all third party applications (not core apps), for  
compatibility with your new ownCloud version. Then disable all of them 
before starting the upgrade.

Next put your server in maintenance mode. This prevents new logins, 
locks the sessions of logged-in users, and displays a status screen so users 
know what is happening. There are two ways to do this, and the preferred method 
is to use the ``occ`` command, which you must run as your HTTP user. This example
is for Ubuntu Linux::

 $ sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --on
 
Please see :doc:`../configuration_server/occ_command` to learn more about ``occ``. 

The other way is by entering your ``config.php`` file and changing 
``'maintenance' => false,`` to ``'maintenance' => true,``. 

1. Back up your existing ownCloud Server database, data directory, and 
   ``config.php`` file. (See :doc:`backup`.)
2. Download and unpack the latest ownCloud Server release (Archive file) from 
   `owncloud.org/install/ 
   <https://owncloud.org/install/>`_ into an empty directory outside 
   of your current installation. For example, if your current ownCloud is 
   installed in ``/var/www/owncloud/`` you could create a new directory called
   ``/var/www/owncloud2/``
3. Stop your web server.

Apache 2 is the recommended server for ownCloud (see :doc:`../release_notes` 
for recommended setups and supported platforms.)

  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
  | Operating System      | Command (as root)                       |
  +=======================+=========================================+
  | CentOS/ Red Hat       |  ``apachectl stop``                     |         
  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
  | Debian                |                                         |
  | or                    | ``/etc/init.d/apache2 stop``            |
  | Ubuntu                |                                         |
  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
  | SUSE Enterprise       |                                         |
  | Linux 11              | ``/usr/sbin/rcapache2 stop``            |       
  |                       |                                         |
  | openSUSE 12.3 and up  | ``systemctl stop apache2``              |
  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+

4. Rename or move your current ownCloud directory (named ``owncloud/`` if 
   installed using defaults) to another location.

5. Unpack your new tarball::

    tar xjf owncloud-latest.tar.bz2
    
6. This creates a new ``owncloud/`` directory populated with your new server 
   files. Copy this directory and its contents to the original location of your 
   old server, for example ``/var/www/``, so that once again you have 
   ``/var/www/owncloud`` .

7. Copy and paste the ``config.php`` file from your old version of 
   ownCloud to your new ownCloud version.

8. If you keep your ``data/`` directory in your ``owncloud/`` directory, copy 
   it from your old version of ownCloud to the ``owncloud/`` directory of 
   your new ownCloud version. If you keep it outside of ``owncloud/`` then 
   you don't have to do anything with it, because its location is configured in 
   your original ``config.php``, and none of the upgrade steps touch it.

.. note:: We recommend storing your ``data/`` directory in a location other 
   than your ``owncloud/`` directory.

9. Restart your web server.

  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
  | Operating System      | Command (as root)                       |
  +=======================+=========================================+
  | CentOS/ Red Hat       |  ``apachectl start``                    |         
  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
  | Debian                |                                         |
  | or                    | ``/etc/init.d/apache2 start``           |
  | Ubuntu                |                                         |
  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
  | SUSE Enterprise       |                                         |
  | Linux 11              | ``/usr/sbin/rcapache2 start``           |       
  |                       |                                         |
  | openSUSE 12.3 and up  | ``systemctl start apache2``             |
  +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+

10. Now you should be able to open a Web browser to your ownCloud server and 
    log in as usual. You have a couple more steps to go: You should see a 
    **Start Update** screen, just like in the **Upgrading With Your Linux 
    Package Manager** section, above. Review the prerequisites, and if you have 
    followed all the steps click the **Start Update** button.    
    
    If you are running a large installation with a lot of files and users, 
    you should launch the upgrade from the command  line using ``occ`` to 
    avoid PHP timeouts, like this example on Ubuntu Linux::
    
     $ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
     
   .. note:: The ``occ`` command does not download ownCloud updates. You must first download
      and install the updated code (steps 1-3), and then ``occ`` performs the final upgrade steps.  
     
11. The upgrade operation takes a few minutes, depending on the size of your 
    installation. When it is finished you will see a success message, or an 
    error message that will tell where it went wrong.   

Assuming your upgrade succeeded, take a look at the bottom of your Admin page to 
verify the version number. Check your other settings to make sure they're 
correct. Go to the Apps page and review the core apps to make sure the right 
ones are enabled. Finally, re-enable your third-party apps.

Setting Strong Permissions
--------------------------
   
For hardened security we  highly recommend setting the permissions on your 
ownCloud directory as strictly as possible. After upgrading, verify that your ownCloud
directory permissions are set according to the **Setting Strong Directory Permissions** 
section of :doc:`../installation/installation_wizard`.

Restore From Backup
-------------------

If you need to reverse your upgrade, see :doc:`restore`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

When upgrading ownCloud and you are running MySQL or MariaDB with binary logging 
enabled, your upgrade may fail with these errors in your MySQL/MariaDB log::

 An unhandled exception has been thrown:
 exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1665 
 Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since 
 BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage engine limited 
 to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to row-logging when transaction 
 isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED.' 

There are two solutions. One is to disable binary logging. Binary logging 
records all changes to your database, and how long each change took. The 
purpose of binary logging is to enable replication and to support backup 
operations.

The other is to change the BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT in your database 
configuration file, or possibly in your database startup script, to 
BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED. See `Overview of the Binary 
Log <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/overview-of-the-binary-log/>`_ and `The 
Binary Log <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/binary-log.html>`_ for 
detailed information.

Occasionally, *files do not show up after a upgrade*. A rescan of the files can help::

 $ sudo -u www-data php console.php files:scan --all

See `the owncloud.org support page <http://owncloud.org/support>`_ for further
resources for both home and enterprise users.

Sometimes, ownCloud can get *stuck in a upgrade*. This is usually due to the process taking too long and encountering a time-out. It is recommended to turn off the upgrade and start over with the manual process from the command line as described above under point 12.

Stop the upgrade process this way::

     $ sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off
  
And start the manual process::
  
    $ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade

If this does not work properly, try the repair function::

    $ sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:repair
