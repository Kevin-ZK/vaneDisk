General Troubleshooting
-----------------------

ownCloud Logfiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a standard ownCloud installation the log level is set to ``Normal``. To find 
any issues you need to raise the log level to ``All`` from the Admin page. 
Please see :doc:`../configuration_server/logging_configuration` for more 
information on these log levels.

Some logging - for example JavaScript console logging - needs manually editing the
configuration file.
Edit :file:`config/config.php` and add ``define('DEBUG', true);``::

    <?php
    define('DEBUG',true);
    $CONFIG = array (
        ... configuration goes here ...
    );

For JavaScript issues you will also need to view the javascript console. All major browsers
have decent developer tools for viewing the console, and you usually access them by
pressing F-12. For Firefox it is recommended to install the `Firebug extension <https://getfirebug.com/>`_.

.. note:: The logfile of ownCloud is located in the data directory 
   ``/var/www/owncloud/data/owncloud.log``.

phpinfo
~~~~~~~

You will need to know your PHP version and configurations. To do this, create a 
plain-text file named **phpinfo.php** and place it in your Web root, for 
example ``/var/www/html/phpinfo.php``. (Your Web root may be in a different 
location; your Linux distribution documentation will tell you where.) This file 
contains just this line::

 <?php phpinfo(); ?>

Open this file in a Web browser. Your PHP version is at the top, and the rest of 
the page contains abundant system information such as active modules, active 
`.ini` files, and much more. When you are finished reviewing your information 
you must delete ``phpinfo.php``, or move it outside of your Web directory, 
because it is a security risk to expose such sensitive data.

Debugging Sync-Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The data directory on the server is exclusive to ownCloud and must not be modified manually.

Disregarding this can lead to unwanted behaviours like:

* Problems with sync clients
* Undetected changes due to caching in the database

If you need to directly upload files from the same server please use a WebDAV command
line client like ``cadaver`` to upload files to the WebDAV interface at:

  https://example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav

Common problems / error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some common problems / error messages found in your logfiles as described above:

* ``SQLSTATE[HY000] [1040] Too many connections`` -> You need to increase the
  connection limit of your database, please refer to the manual of your database
  for more information.
* ``SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 5 database is locked`` -> You're using ``SQLite``
  which can't handle a lot of parallel requests. Please consider converting to
  another database like described in :doc:`../configuration_database/db_conversion`.
* ``SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away`` -> The database
  request takes too long and therefore the MySQL server times out. Its also possible
  that the server is dropping a packet that is too large. Please refer to the manual of your
  database for how to raise the config options ``wait_timeout`` and/or ``max_allowed_packet``.
* ``SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory`` -> There is a problem
  accessing your SQLite database file in your data directory (``data/owncloud.db``).
  Please check the permissions of this folder/file or if it exists at all. If you're
  using MySQL please start your database.
* ``Connection closed / Operation cancelled`` -> This could be caused by wrong ``KeepAlive``
  settings within your Apache config. Make sure that ``KeepAlive`` is set to ``On`` and
  also try to raise the limits of ``KeepAliveTimeout`` and ``MaxKeepAliveRequests``.

Troubleshooting Webserver and PHP problems
------------------------------------------

Logfiles
~~~~~~~~

When having issues the first step is to check the logfiles provided by PHP, the Webserver
and ownCloud itself.

.. note:: In the following the paths to the logfiles of a default Debian installation
   running Apache2 with mod_php is assumed. On other webservers, linux distros or
   operating systems they can differ.

* The logfile of Apache2 is located in ``/var/log/apache2/error.log``.
* The logfile of PHP can be configured in your ``/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini``. 
  You need to set the directive ``log_errors`` to ``On`` and choose the path
  to store the logfile in the ``error_log`` directive. After those changes you
  need to restart your Webserver.
* The logfile of ownCloud is located in the data directory ``/var/www/owncloud/data/owncloud.log``.

Webserver and PHP modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some Webserver or PHP modules which are known to cause various problems
like broken up-/downloads. The following shows a draft overview of these modules:

1. Apache

* mod_pagespeed
* mod_evasive
* mod_security
* mod_reqtimeout
* mod_deflate
* libapache2-mod-php5filter (use libapache2-mod-php5 instead)
* mod_spdy together with libapache2-mod-php5 / mod_php (use fcgi or php-fpm instead)
* mod_dav
* mod_xsendfile / X-Sendfile (causing broken downloads if not configured correctly)

2. NginX

* ngx_pagespeed
* HttpDavModule
* X-Sendfile (causing broken downloads if not configured correctly)

3. Mac OS X server

* mod_auth_apple
* com.apple.webapp.webdavsharing

4. LigHTTPd

* ModWebDAV
* X-Sendfile2 (causing broken downloads if not configured correctly)

5. PHP

* eAccelerator

Troubleshooting WebDAV
----------------------

ownCloud uses SabreDAV, and the SabreDAV documentation is comprehensive and 
helpful. See:

* `SabreDAV FAQ <http://sabre.io/dav/faq/>`_
* `Webservers <http://sabre.io/dav/webservers>`_ (Lists lighttpd as not 
  recommended)
* `Working with large files <http://sabre.io/dav/large-files/>`_ (Shows a PHP 
  bug in older SabreDAV versions and information for mod_security problems)
* `0 byte files <http://sabre.io/dav/0bytes>`_ (Reasons for empty files on the 
  server)
* `Clients <http://sabre.io/dav/clients/>`_ (A comprehensive list of WebDAV 
  clients, and possible problems with each one)
* `Finder, OS X's built-in WebDAV client 
  <http://sabre.io/dav/clients/finder/>`_ 
  (Describes problems with Finder on various webservers)

There is also a well maintained FAQ thread available at the `ownCloud Forums <https://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=7536>`_
which contains various additional information about WebDAV problems.

Troubleshooting Contacts & Calendar
-----------------------------------

Service discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some clients - especially iOS - have problems finding the proper sync URL, even when explicitly
configured to use it.

There are several techniques to remedy this, which are described extensively at the
`Sabre DAV website <http://sabre.io/dav/service-discovery/>`_.

Apple iOS
~~~~~~~~~

Below is what has been proven to work with iOS including iOS 7.

If your ownCloud instance is installed in a subfolder under the web server's document root and
the client has difficulties finding the Cal- or CardDAV end-points, configure your web server to
redirect from a "well-known" URL to the one used by ownCloud.
When using the Apache web server this is easily achieved using a :file:`.htaccess` file in the document
root of your site.

Say your instance is located in the ``owncloud`` folder, so the URL to it is ``ADDRESS/owncloud``,
create or edit the :file:`.htaccess` file and add the following lines::

    Redirect 301 /.well-known/carddav /owncloud/remote.php/carddav
    Redirect 301 /.well-known/caldav /owncloud/remote.php/caldav

If you use lighttpd as the web server, the setting looks something like::

    url.redirect = (
        "^/.well-known/carddav" => "/owncloud/remote.php/carddav",
        "^/.well-known/caldav" => "/owncloud/remote.php/caldav",
    )

Now change the URL in the client settings to just use ``ADDRESS`` instead of e.g. ``ADDRESS/remote.php/carddav/principals/username``.

This problem is being discussed in the `forum <http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=71&p=2211#p2197>`_.

Unable to update Contacts or Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you get an error like ``PATCH https://ADDRESS/some_url HTTP/1.0 501 Not Implemented`` it is
likely caused by one of the following reasons:

Outdated lighttpd web server
  lighttpd in debian wheezy (1.4.31) doesn't support the PATCH HTTP verb.
  Upgrade to lighttpd >= 1.4.33.

Using Pound reverse-proxy/load balancer
  As of writing this Pound doesn't support the HTTP/1.1 verb.
  Pound is easily `patched <http://www.apsis.ch/pound/pound_list/archive/2013/2013-08/1377264673000>`_ to support HTTP/1.1.
